Supplementary Files for the paper **"Delayed response to environmental conditions and infra-seasonal dynamics of the short-beaked common dolphin distribution"**, by C. Lambert, M. Authier, S. Laran and J. Spitz. 

In this repository, you will find supplementary figures displaying the daily variations in environmental conditions over the course of the season, from December 1st to April 13th in 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. These figures are presented for all dynamic variables: Temp, Salinity, CurrentSpeed, Chl, NPP, Phyto, EKE, DissIC, SPCO2, SSH, MLD, ZEu, gradSSH, gradTemp, gradMLD, gradSal, gradChl, gradNPP, Dist MLD front, Dist Chl front, Dist NPP front, Dist Temp front. We also present the spatial distribution of static variables, namely the persistence of MLD, Chl, NPP and Temp fronts.

Day-to-day predictions of common dolphins are also shown, alongside the model-derived uncertainty associated to predictions. Day-to-day maps of extrapolations are also presented. 

The uncertainty and extrapolations maps derived from the seasonal model are also displayed.
